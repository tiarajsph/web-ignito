Ignito

Ignito is a frontend-only web project designed as a mock college event website. It simulates how an official college fest or event portal might look, including landing sections, event information, and visual branding.

This project was built primarily to practice frontend development and UI structuring.

📌 About the Project

Ignito is a static event website created to represent a fictional college event.
It focuses on layout, responsiveness, and visual presentation rather than backend functionality.
